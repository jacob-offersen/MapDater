A fun side project that can help estimate the age of a map or globe.
The idea came after seeing some posts on the subreddit "MapPorn". 
Here users post images of maps or globes and ask the community to help them determine the date of the map.
By asking asking a range of questions relating to details which should be visible on the map this priject tries to estimated the age.
